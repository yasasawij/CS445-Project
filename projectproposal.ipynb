    "# Project Proposal:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we will apply a neural network learning algorithm to the MS-COCO dataset, focusing on image classification. Our goal is to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images into their respective categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to answer the following questions:\n",
    "- How accurately can a neural network classify images from the MS-COCO dataset?\n",
    "- Can we interpret the behavior of hidden layers and understand decision-making processes in our model?\n",
    "- Which types of images or classes are most often misclassified, and why?\n",
    "- Can tuning hyperparameters improve model performance to outperform a baseline model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypotheses:\n",
    "- A properly tuned convolutional neural network will outperform a simpler baseline model such as logistic regression or random forest.\n",
    "- Certain classes in MS-COCO, especially those with high intra-class variance or low sample counts, will have higher misclassification rates.\n",
    "- Visualizing hidden layer activations will reveal that the CNN is focusing on key features such as object edges and textures."

    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this project?\n",
    "\n",
    "MS-COCO is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset containing diverse images and multiple classes. It provides a challenging and interesting dataset for testing deep learning algorithms, especially CNNs, due to the variety of objects, backgrounds, and perspectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to complete the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection:**\n",
